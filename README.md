Integer to Roman numeral conversion programming 
Python programming language has been choosed in this project to for the conversion of Roman numeral to Integer

Roman numeral codes and its equivalent integers has been mapped in dictionary
roman_numerals = {1:'I', 5:'V', 10:'X', 50:'L', 100:'C', 500:'D', 1000:'M'}

function 'get_roman_numerals' has been defined and called. This function has two dependent functions.

This function takes the one Integer argument which will then be converted to Roman numeral and the same will be returned.
